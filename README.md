# Kakashi for Quarto Reveal.js

This Quarto extension is a personalized version of [malcolmbarrett's](https://github.com/malcolmbarrett/) [kakashi-quarto-theme](https://github.com/malcolmbarrett/kakashi-quarto-theme), which

> copies ideas from many other xaringan themes, including metropolis and lucy, but is ultimately unique. That is why this CSS (copy shinobi style) is called kakashi, [after the copy ninja](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Kakashi_Hatake).

[malcolmbarrett's](https://github.com/malcolmbarrett/) [kakashi-quarto-theme](https://github.com/malcolmbarrett/kakashi-quarto-theme) is also based on [Bea Milz's](https://beamilz.com/) [R-Ladies](https://github.com/beatrizmilz/quarto-rladies-theme) Quarto theme and [Emil Hvitfeldt's](https://www.emilhvitfeldt.com/) [nes theme](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/quarto-nes-theme).

## Some style notes

- Marking text as italics (\*) will turn it blue, bold (\*\*) will turn it orange, and striking out (~~) will turn it grey.
- Bullets are automatically grayed-out when you increment through them.

## How to install and use the template

This [Quarto](https://quarto.org) extension can be installed with:
